With Sendit, you can ask for someone to pick up your item and deliver it to your friend. Piece of cake, right?\r\n\r\nOr do you want to give other people a hand? You can also be the one making the delivery! \r\n\r\nWith Snedit you can be one, or both. It's your choice.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nSendit is being developed by: Macarena Saenz (@macasaenz), Nicol√°s Vinciguerra (@nicolasvinciguerra) and Rodrigo Zampa (@rodrigoz).
